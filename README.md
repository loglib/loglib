# Introduction

Welcome to Loglib! honestly it's just yet another web analytics :)

## What is Loglib?

Loglib is a **Open Source** and **Privacy-First** web analytics that can be attached to your app. Admittedly it has beautiful dashboard built with schadcn ui and the hosted version comes with api that you can use to get your data back.

## Why Loglib?

- Why not?
- No need to deploy it separately. You can easily attach Loglib to your Next js app (more framework support soon), and you can see your website analytics. (despite having 0 users)
- Keep all your data in your existing database, you have the freedom to store your data in your existing db or your choice of db. We currently support prisma and supabase adapters but more supports are on the way.
- Behold the beauty of your dashboard, powered by Shadcn UI.
- Privacy-first and GDPR compliant out of the box, with customization options.
- You can see basic analytics like vercel analytics but also events aren't paid and it's better than...
- Your mom will be impressed.
- And more things are on the way.
