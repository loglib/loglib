# Installation

<Callout>
  Currently LogLib supports Next JS by native, but we are working on supporting
  other frameworks as well. If you want to use LogLib with other frameworks, you
  can follow the [manual setup](#other-frameworks--separate-deployments) guide.

### Adding loglib to Next JS 🔥?

#### Install like every other library

```bash
pnpm add @loglib/next
```

loglib ships with a cli tool that helps you setup your project. You can run the following command to setup your project and watch as the magic unfolds:

```bash
pnpm loglib init
```

To update all the loglib packages in your app, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm loglib update
```

this will setup your project with all possible configurations. Refer to the [Advanced Docs](/advanced) for more information.

### Other Frameworks / Separate Deployments

1. clone [https://github.com/LogLib/loglib-starter](https://github.com/LogLib/loglib-starter) this repo and run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.
2. change .env.example to .env and fill in the required env variables
3. migrate your database with `pnpm prisma migrate` or `pnpm prisma db push`
4. You can now deploy but if you're deploying to platforms other than vercel you need to setup location resolver for your server. [Read more](https://github.com/loglib/loglib/#resolving-user-location-from-ip)
5. Now go to your project where you want to track and put loglib url in the `LOGLIB_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGLIB_URL` env variable.
6. Install the loglib tracker in `pnpm i @loglib/tracker`
7. Follow the instructions in the [doc](https://github.com/LogLib/loglib#loglib-tracker) to setup the tracker.
