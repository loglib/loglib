We are thrilled to announce the beta release of Teams, a powerful collaboration feature that will revolutionize the way you work on your websites. With Teams, you can now create groups and invite your teammates to join, making it easier than ever to collaborate and achieve your goals together.

Building and maintaining a website often requires teamwork, whether you're working on a personal project or managing a professional site. We understand the importance of seamless collaboration, which is why we've developed Teams to streamline the process and enhance your productivity.

With the Teams feature, you can:

1. Create Teams: Create dedicated teams for your websites, projects, or specific areas of focus. Whether you're working on a small personal blog or a large-scale enterprise website, Teams provides you with the flexibility to organize your collaborators efficiently.

2. Invite Collaborators: Invite your teammates, clients, or external contributors to join your Teams. Simply send an invitation, and they'll be able to access the websites associated with your Teams, enabling seamless collaboration and real-time updates.

3. Assign Roles and Permissions: Take control of your team's access and define their roles and permissions within your websites. Assign team members as administrators, editors, or viewers, depending on their level of involvement. This granular control ensures that sensitive information remains secure while allowing everyone to contribute effectively.

Please note that Teams is currently in beta, which means we are actively seeking feedback from our users to improve the feature further. We encourage you to explore Teams, provide feedback, and report any issues you encounter. Your valuable input will help us refine and enhance the Teams experience for all users.
